# Module 11 Challenge: *UFO Webpage*

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to help data journalist Dana share her article and research findings with her audience via an interactive webpage. She wanted to provide the data to her readers so that they could determine for themselves if aliens are real and are possibly trying to contact us. Dana recruited our help in making the webpage as she wanted visitors to the site to be able to not only read her article but also easily filter through the data she's gathered with a table and search bars. 

## Results
When users first come to the website, they are greeted by Dana's article and some light webpage stylization. After reading the article and scrolling down, they are able to interact with the table we built.

The following is an explanation of how visitors to the website can use the table: 

### Table Use Process 
1. First, the user needs to determine what they are looking for. For demonstrative purposes, we're going to use an example visitor, "Jane". Jane is looking for a specific UFO event on a specific date in a specific country. She'll start by navigating to the left of the table to its filter search bars.

2. Next, in the *Enter Date* search bar, Jane is going to type in the specific date she's looking for. After inputting the date she's going to press **Enter** on her keyboard. The table will display all of the entries that fall under that specific date.

3. After that, Jane is going to input the specific country she wants to see results from in the *Enter a Country* search bar. After pressing **Enter**, the table will now display results from the two search criteria she has inputted so far.

4. Finally, Jane is going to input her last search criteria into the *Enter a Shape* search bar. Once she presses **Enter**, the table will display the results from all three search criteria. If she so wanted to, Jane could filter the results even further by state or city; however, in this example doing so would be pointless as there are only 4 results for our current search criteria.

To clear the results all Jane would have to do is delete the inputs in the search bars, press **Enter**, and the table will return the full data set again. 


## Summary
In conclusion, while the webpage fulfills the basic function of giving readers an interactive way to read Dana's article and view the data, there are many areas it is lacking in. One major drawback is the visual design of the webpage. The entire page is mostly one color, there is little separation between the article and the table, and the table itself looks very crowded and saturated with text. In order to improve the webpage, here are my recommendations on the design and a few other things.
### Recommendations for Improvement
1. The entire wepage needs better layout and stylization. There should be different colors and/or styles that separates the article and the table.
2. The webpage really should include Dana's name to credit her for the article. She spent all this time writing it and gathering the data, so she should have her name attached to it. 
3. We should clean up the table to be more visually appealing. For example, use color, shapes, and text styles to make the table more readable and visually appealing. 
4. We should also clean up the data to fix poor grammar and add proper capitalization
